## What's this?
This image is a fork from [osixia/openldap](https://github.com/osixia/docker-openldap)

It only exists to support DCC UFRJ internal ldifs format, that doesn't work properly using osixia original image. **This image will be deleted sooner or later, so don't use it, unless you are a LCI member!**

## Build

Check Makefile to set proper image name and version then:

```
make build
```
